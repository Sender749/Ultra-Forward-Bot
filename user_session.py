user_session.py — Optional Pyrogram *user* client ("userbot"), authenticated
with a Pyrogram session string belonging to a personal Telegram account.

Why this exists
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The main `Bot` client in bot.py is a bot account. Telegram bots can only see
messages in chats they've been explicitly added to (as a member or admin) —
there's no way around this via the Bot API/MTProto as a bot. If someone is a
regular member of a channel but never added this bot to it, the bot has
ZERO access to that channel, full stop.

A personal account, on the other hand, already has access to every chat it's
a member of. plugins/member_forward.py uses this second client to read (and,
where possible, directly copy) messages from those channels, so files can
still be pulled out and forwarded into any channel this bot's admin owns.

Setup
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Use the bot's own /gen_session command to generate this string interactively,
or generate one locally:

    from pyrogram import Client
    from config import Config
    with Client("gen", api_id=Config.API_ID, api_hash=Config.API_HASH, in_memory=True) as app:
        print(app.export_session_string())

Set the printed string as the SESSION_STRING environment variable. If it's
left unset, /member_forward simply replies that the feature is disabled
(checked via USER_SESSION_ENABLED) — nothing else in the bot is affected.

Security note: a session string grants FULL access to that Telegram account
(read every chat, send messages, even delete the account) — treat it like a
password. Never share it, log it, or commit it to source control.
